# Hackathon Project
Problem statement As cities grow, efficient logistics and transport are vital for productivity and safety. A consulting firm must solve two key urban mobility challenges.

Logistics & Delivery Challenges üöõ India ranks 38th in the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) 2023 ‚è≥ 40% of total delivery time is wasted in traffic congestion (NITI Aayog). üí∞ Logistics costs in India are 14% of GDP, compared to 8-9% in developed countries (World Bank).
Urban Traffic & Public Transport Issues üöó Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru among the top 10 most congested cities globally (TomTom Traffic Index 2023). üî• 2.5x increase in CO‚ÇÇ emissions due to inefficient routes (Centre for Science and Environment). üè• India records 1.5 lakh road accident deaths (MoRTH Report 2023).

Context & Significance (Delhi‚Äôs Data) the same model can be easily adapted to other cities, states, and countries with minimal tweaks.

Urban Mobility & Logistics in Delhi: Delhi‚Äôs traffic congestion worsens delivery delays, impacting businesses and consumers. Warehouses struggle with rising demand & inefficient route planning. Peak-hour gridlocks at key choke points slow down last-mile delivery. Urban Motion Intelligence

‚úÖDelhi faces severe congestion, unpredictable public transit demand & accident hotspots. ‚úÖISBT terminals & Metro stations experience peak-hour overcrowding. ‚úÖAccident-prone zones like ITO, Dhaula Kuan, and Outer Ring Road pose safety risks. ‚úÖPublic transport inefficiencies push commuters toward private vehicles, worsening traffic.
